UAPPING is a web application created to enhance communication among sectoral groups at the University of Aveiro (UA) and its student body. The platform focuses on facilitating the sharing and promotion of events to enrich the university community experience. Additionally, UAPPING aims to foster student engagement by encouraging discussions and enabling the formation of new interest-based groups.

**Development Context:**
UAPPING was conceived and developed during the second semester of the second year of the Bachelor's program in New Communication Technologies. The project embodies the spirit of "From students, to students," reflecting its commitment to addressing the communication needs and interests of the university's diverse student population.
